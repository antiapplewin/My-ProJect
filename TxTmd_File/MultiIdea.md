This is NOT A GOOD Sight<br/>
Maybe We Need some DELETE
and start over again

WE NEED TO START OVER

__*Need Fixing*__ : <br/>
delete "the number game" (for now) <br/>
Create "*__Master__*" Role <br/>
Create Random Generator <br/>
Start Over "*__main2__*" <br/>
Focus on the server (most of the Calculations)

When the code got settled<br/> I'll continue my multiplayer project!
